## Commands to manage guild

* `/list_guilds` : lists all guilds
* `/join_guild <guild_name>`   : join a guild if it exists
* `/leave_guild <guild_name>`  : leave a guild
* `/create_guild <guild_name>` : create a guild
* `/remove_guild <guild_name>` : players with `guild_priv` can delete the guild
* `/gm <msg>` : sends a private message to all guild members

* guild by default modifies the chat so other mods that have similar behaviour might interfere


TODO :

* extend api.lua to have gulid store more metadata
* Add a random colorization to guild names while writing guild colors or maybe approach a fixed coloration for each guild
